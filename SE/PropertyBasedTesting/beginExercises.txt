exercise 1
- an empty list should have 0 as its sum
- the sum of two lists should be equal to the sum of the lists individually, then added

- if the elements within the list are all greater than zero, the sum should be greater than zero
- if the elements of the list are the same value, the sum is length of the list multiplied by the value of an element in the list


exercise2
- if the maximum element of the list is the first element, the function that finds the maximum of List[Int] should return the head of the list
- the function returns the greatest element in the list
